# Indoor-Temperature-Prediction-Coefficients
Generate coefficients for predicting indoor temperature in optimization for simulations such as:  https://github.com/SCU-Smart-Grid-CPS/TwoFedEPOpt

To Use: 

Choose the MATLAB or GNU Octave version of the v3.1 script as appropriate

Run the Basic Simulations for your location and TMY weather file found here: https://github.com/SCU-Smart-Grid-CPS/Energy-Plus-Co-Sim-Models

Rename the Loc_Basic.csv and put it in the same directory as the MATLAB/Octave script. 

Change the name of the "infile" variable to match the csv.

Run the script.

Coefficients c1 to c3 or c4 and the RMSE appear in the Command Window.
